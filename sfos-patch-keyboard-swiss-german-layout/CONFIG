Summary: Patch adding a new Swiss German keyboard layout.
Description:
- This patch adds a new Swiss German keyboard layout.
-
- Many special characters are available if you long-press a key.
-
- The new layout includes an extra row of keys. Therefore I recommend installing
- the <a href="https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/patch-smaller-keyboard">smaller keyboard patch</a>
- which reduces the default height of the keyboard so it does not take as much
- space on the screen.
-
- Switching between keyboards may become slower because of the extra row.
- This cannot be changed unless the other keyboards add another row too. You
- can install the <a href="https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/patch-improved-stock-emoji-keyboard">improved emojis patch</a>
- to add an extra row to the stock emojis keyboard.
