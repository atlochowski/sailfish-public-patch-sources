Summary: Keyboard adapted to 'long' phones (like Xperia 10)
Description:
- Using the keyboard on phones with a 'long' form factor like the Xperia 10
- can be quite uncomfortable. This patch moves the entire keyboard higher up
- on the screen to make it easier accessible without having to lose grip.
-
- *Note:*
- It would be nice if someone who actually has such a long phone could provide
- two 'before and after' screenshots!
-
- *Credits:*
- I am only the packager of this patch. The idea was raised
- [here](https://together.jolla.com/question/220879/idea-raise-the-keyboard-on-long-devices/)
- where [Edz](https://together.jolla.com/users/907/edz/) provided the first
- patch. It was further improved by [rdomschk](https://openrepos.net/users/rdomschk).
