Summary: Patch adding "overloaded" characters to the keys next to the spacebar.
Description:
- This patch adds "overloaded" characters to the keys next to the spacebar.
-
- Many keyboard layouts have alternative characters added to a key which you can
- select by pressing the key for a few moments. This patch adds some alternative
- characters to the keys next to the spacebar, too.
-
- If you think some very important character is missing, please tell me in the
- comments!
-
- Note: this patch conflicts with the
- [apostrophe key patch](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/patch-apostrophe-key-all-keyboards).
- Therefore I added the same characters there, too.
