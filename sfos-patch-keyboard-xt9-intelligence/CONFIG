Maintainer: ichthyosaurus
Summary: Improve handling of special characters in text prediction
Description:
- Improve handling of special characters with XT9 (predictive text input).
- The patch adds special rules for braces, typographical quotation marks, colons,
- ellipsis ("..."), etc. Some extra rules are added for nuances of the French and German grammar rules.
-
- The stock XT9's handling of special characters leaves quite a lot to be wished for.
- This patch tries to improve it a little bit but it is still far from perfect.
- For example, I didn't find a way (yet?) to automatically add closing braces and place the cursor in between.
